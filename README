ProGuard Maven Plugin
---------------------
  with support for the modularised ProGuard Maven modules

Original homepage:
  http://pyx4me.com/pyx4me-maven-plugins/proguard-maven-plugin/
This fork supports modularised ProGuard Maven modules as well, which has
currently (June, 2011) more recent versions in Maven Central. Instead of
the dependency net.sf.proguard:proguard you can now also use
net.sf.proguard:proguard-base (or any of the other modules). Please see the
original proguard-maven-plugin for more information.
